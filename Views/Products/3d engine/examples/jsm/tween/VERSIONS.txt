Version 1.0.0 (September 14, 2017)
****************************************************************************************************
CRITICAL (may break existing content):
- Plugin model has changed significantly. See SamplePlugin for information.
- Second param of Tween/Timeline.setPosition() is now runActions boolean
- Removed Tween.NONE, Tween.LOOP, and Tween.REVERSE constants
- pluginData is now a property in the props param, instead of its own param
- Removed Tween.installPlugin, in favour of Plugin.install()
- Removed Tween.tick (instance) in favour of Tween.advance
- Tween actions in a Timeline now run after all the tween properties are updated
- added check for hasOwnProperty on tween properties to filter out inherited properties
- Changed version naming to use tweenjs.js, instead of containing the version number

*****
DEPRECATED (will break in the future):
- Timeline constructor now expects a single param `props`, which now supports `tweens` and `labels` properties
- to make a tween loop continuously, you should now use loop:-1, instead of loop:true
- setPaused deprecated in favor of paused getter / setter
- getCurrentLabel deprecated in favor of currentLabel getter / setter
- Deprecated get/set methods are now protect with an underscore (eg _setEnabled)
	The deprecated methods and properties will still work, but will display a console warning when used.

*****

- Tween and Timeline now extend AbstractTween
- Tween and Timeline now have more similar/consistent interfaces

- Timeline.tweens added
- improvements / additions to examples
- added callback param to setPosition for MovieClip use
- fixed a bug with Tween.set()
- unit tests made somewhat more robust
- added a shared createjs.deprecate() method, which wraps old methods and property getter/setters to display
	a console warning when used.
